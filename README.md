# Library for grid world environments

## Author: Marlos C. Machado

I still need to write a proper README file.

However, an example using the main functionalities of this library is available in `sarsa.py`. To run my code, simply do:

`python3 sarsa.py -i mdps/4rooms.mdp -o output/ -s 30`

Make sure you create the directory `output` in this folder.
